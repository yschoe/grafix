* lattice : 
   - fuer grosse z-Werte Darstellung begrenzen (Laufzeit !)

* class-browser : loop-Fehler, graph. Anordnung der buttons verbessern

* customizations : button-colors, backgrd-color, click-to-type 
  from .Xresources and/or local custom-file

* makefile, grafix.mk clean up

* better icons !

* replay hangs after few steps when *both* spawn and synchron are active !
    (synchr seems to fail)

* rotate mode for lattices, region manager should open a new lattice window, 
	and both views can be shown simultaniously

* class_browser : popup windows should display whole file 
	(but scrollbar set according to class def. in text)

> Just a couple of points:  In win-demo, pulldown1 does not work properly,
> but pulldown2 does.   Secondly, in the file-browser, after resizing the
> window all the columns are used, but only the number of rows from the

* dir-tree could be easily extended 
	display directory content on button press :
	- full directory info (access permissions, date)
	-
